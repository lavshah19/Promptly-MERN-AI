# Promptly 🧠💬

**Promptly** is a simple AI chat interface built with **React** on the frontend and a lightweight **Node.js + Express** backend, using **Google's Gemini API** for generating responses.

This project was created as a practice to explore integrating **Gemini AI** into a fullstack app. It does **not include a database** (like MongoDB) yet, but you can easily extend it to store chat history or user data.
